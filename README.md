# EvoRun Overview

EvoRun is a simple runner style game. The player controlls a character (sonic), and moves him between three lanes to choose different math cards that can increase or decrease his shields.

## Gameplay

Using the keyboard, the player switches between "lanes" to choose between different math cards that will either increase or decrease his number of shields. After choosing a card and accepting the outcome, the player then faces a field of lava(currently always the same size), which decreases his shields while he traverses it. The player then moves on to his next set of choices and this continues until he either wins the game (undecided), or looses all his shields.
