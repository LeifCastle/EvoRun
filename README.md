# EvoRun Overview

EvoRun is a simple runner game. Using the keyboard, the player switches between "lanes" to choose between different cards that will either benefit him or harm him. After choosing a card and accepting the outcome, the player then faces an obstacle(undecided but possibly a certain number of enemies). The player then moves on to his next set of choices and this continues until he either wins the game (undecided), or looses a certain number of (undecided but likely clones of himself).
